  abstract =  {In this paper, the concept of M-fuzzifying submodular functions is
	introduced, which is a generalization of submodular functions in
	matroid theory. It is shown that M-fuzzifying matroids can be generated
	from an M-fuzzifying submodular function in different ways. A circuit-map,
	an M-fuzzifying family of independent sets and an M-fuzzifying family
	of dependent sets are obtained from an M-fuzzifying submodular function.
	We also present an M-fuzzifying submodular function on a lattice
	$\mathcal{L}_{E}$ and obtain an M-fuzzifying matroid from it. Moreover,
	new characterizations of base-maps and circuit-maps are obtained
	by means of an M-fuzzifying rank function. At last, the notion of
	the union of M-fuzzifying matriods is introduced and a result of
	the union of M-fuzzifying matriods associated with M-fuzzifying submodular
	functions is obtained. We also establish generalizations of Edmonds'
	Intersection Theorem and Edmonds' Covering Theorem in the framework
	of M-fuzzifying matriod.},
